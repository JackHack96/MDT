# MDT
Little Turing Machine implementation using the K Framework 4, for the course of Languages 2017/2018 at University of Verona

# Instructions
I used K Framework version 4 for this project.
First compile the file `mdt.k` by running `kompile mdt.k`, then you can use `krun` on one of the examples.

**NOTE**: Given that `krun`'s output is pretty ugly, I've created a Python wrapper for this specific project, which pretty-print everything. Just run `python3 krun.py [EXAMPLE].mdt`.
